# Hello World Machine Learning Classification Project

This is my first end-to-end classification project in Python. 

- [x] It is a multiclass classification problem (multi-nominal) that required some specialized handling, which I have developing in some different of machine learning and statistics courses. 
- [x] It only has 4 attributes and 150 rows, meaning it is small and easily fits into memory (and a screen or single sheet of paper).
- [x] All of the numeric attributes are in the same units and the same scale not requiring any special scaling or transforms to get started.
